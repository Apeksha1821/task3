 Car Price Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of car-related data, focusing on price trends, odometer readings, and model distributions. It helps users explore how various attributes—such as car model, body type, color, and year—affect pricing and mileage.

Dataset Fields
The dashboard uses the following fields:
- `car intelligence`: Additional metadata or scoring
- `color`: Car color
- `company`: Manufacturer or brand
- `fuel type`: Petrol, diesel, electric, etc.
- `model`: Specific car model
- `price`: Sale price of the car
- `year`: Year of manufacture

Visualizations
The report canvas includes three key visuals:
1. Pie Chart – Sum of odometer by body and color  
   - Shows how mileage varies across car body types and colors.

2. Bar Chart – Sum of price by model  
   - Highlights which car models contribute most to overall pricing.

3. Line Chart – Price trend over years by model
   - Reveals how car prices evolve over time for different models.

Filters
Users can interact with filters to refine the data:
- Page-level filters
- Visualization-level filters
- Cross-filtering between visuals

 How to Use
1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Use the Filters pane to narrow down data by year, model, or fuel type.
3. Hover over charts for tooltips and deeper insights.
4. Customize visuals or add new ones using the Visualizations panel.

Purpose
This dashboard is ideal for:
- Car dealerships analyzing pricing trends
- Buyers comparing models and mileage
